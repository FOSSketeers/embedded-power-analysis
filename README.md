# BBM479 Workspace

Well, our project(s) don't have their own name yet. This is our workspace where we do experiments and such, and store everything related to them. To maintain markdown tables more easily, you can use this [handy tool](https://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/). These experiment logs are not definitive, feel free to add new columns.

## Experiments

Using Nordic Power Profile Kit 2, we are measuring power consumptions of certain programs in different microprocessors. We are experimenting with only Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino Uno R4 Minima these days.

### 1. sort

We experiment different sorting algorithms with different arrays in different devices.

### 3. llm-sort

Here we experiment whether there is a significant difference in the performance of sorting algorithm implementations across different LLMs.
